 *
 * This module provides platform independent access to the system watchdog timer
 * which is an embedded peripheral that will reset the system in the case of
 * system failures or malfunctions.
 *
 * The watchdog timer initialises a system timer with a time period specified in
 * the configuration. This timer counts down and triggers a system reset when it
 * wraps. To prevent the system reset the timer must be continually
 * kicked/refreshed by calling hal_watchdog_kick which will reset the countdown
 * to the user specified reset value.
 *
 * The Watchdog timer must continue to operate in low power modes. It
 * must count down and trigger a reset from within both sleep and deep sleep
 * modes unless the chip is woken to refresh the timer.
